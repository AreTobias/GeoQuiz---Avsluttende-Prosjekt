# GeoQuiz

This is a school project which is designed to create a quiz for a user based on geographical questions, and also an administrator gui to create and delete users and questions.

The project is written in Java and uses a mySQL database.

The API I've used to create and validate quiz questions and answers: https://restcountries.com/

1) Oslo | 2) Berlin | 3) Copenhagen | 4) Paris
